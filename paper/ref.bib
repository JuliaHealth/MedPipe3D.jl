abstract = {Fully-automated segmentation algorithms offer fast, objective, and reproducible results for large data collections. However, these techniques cannot handle tasks that require contextual knowledge not readily available in the images alone. Thus, the supervision of an expert is necessary. We present a generative model for image segmentation, based on a Bayesian inference. Not only does our approach support an intuitive and convenient user interaction subject to the bottom-up constraints introduced by the image intensities, it also circumvents the main limitations of a human observer—3D visualization and modality fusion. The user “dialogue” with the segmentation algorithm via several mouse clicks in regions of disagreement, is formulated as a continuous probability map, that represents the user’s certainty to whether the current segmentation should be modified. Considering this probability map as the voxel-vise Bernoulli priors on the image labels allows spatial encoding of the user-provided input. The method is exemplified for the segmentation of cerebral hemorrhages (CH) in human brain CT scans; ventricles in degenerative mice brain MRIs, and tumors in multi-modal human brain MRIs and is shown to outperform three interactive, state-of-the-art segmentation methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency and user-workload.}

  abstract  = {3D Slicer is an open-source platform for the analysis and display of information derived from medical imaging and similar data sets. Such advanced software environments are in daily use by researchers and clinicians and in many nonmedical applications. 3D Slicer is unique through serving clinical users, multidisciplinary clinical research terms, and software architects within a single technology structure and user community. Functions such as interactive visualization, image registration, and model-based analysis are now being complemented by more advanced capabilities, most notably in neurological imaging and intervention. These functions, originally limited to offline use by technical factors, are integral to large scale, rapidly developing research studies, and they are being increasingly integrated into the management and delivery of care. This activity has been led by a community of basic, applied, and clinical scientists and engineers, from both academic and commercial perspectives. 3D Slicer, a free open-source software package, is based in this community; 3D Slicer provides a set of interactive tools and a stable platform that can quickly incorporate new analysis techniques and evolve to serve more sophisticated real-time applications while remaining compatible with the latest hardware and software generations of host computer systems.},
